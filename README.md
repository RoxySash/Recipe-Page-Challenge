- CSS 




### What I learned



To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
body {
    font-family: "Outfit", sans-serif;
    background-color: hsl(330, 100%, 98%);
    font-size: 16px;
    min-height: 100vh;
    display: flex;
    justify-content: center;
    align-items: center;
    padding-top: 80px;
    padding-bottom: 80px;
    line-height: 1.9;
    
}
```
```css
th,td {
    padding-bottom: 0.5rem;
    padding-top: 0.5rem;
    border-bottom: 1px solid lightgray;
}

```



### Continued development

This one was a little hard because there were so many different components with different styles. 
I need to work on table elements. This challenege made me want to do more projects.
